# Data Hiding and Encapsulation

```c++
class Rectangle {
    public:
    	int length,breadth;
    	int area(){
            return length * breadth;
        }
    	int perimeter(){
            return 2*(length+breadth) ;
        }
};
```

Data hiding is related to encapsulation. After encapsulation we move towards data hiding. Above we have a class which has data and functions on that data to do different things with data provided in class. Inside a class by writing everything inside {} we are achieving  encapsulation. But, above we have made everything public and it is not wise to allow direct access using className.dataMember to modify or manipulate the data Members of class as it may lead to mishandling of the variables which are then being passed on to functions. So data should be private and only the functions which are used to access that data should be public. Moreover having proper classes increases the reusability of the code too as it leads to functions which can be accessed and data which is private so everything performs as expected. Now to correct ourselves we make data members as private and functions as public.

```c++
class Rectangle {
    private:
    int length,breadth; // Making data members as private. Read and write of private isn't allowed.
    public:
    	int area(){
            return length * breadth;
        }
    	int perimeter(){
            return 2*(length+breadth) ;
        }
    	void setLength(int l){
            length = l; // Assigns the int l to the private data member length's value
        }
    	void setBreadth(int b){
            breadth = b; // Assigns the int l to the private data member length's value
        }
    	int getLength(){
            return length; // Returns the value of length which is a private data member
        }
    	int getBreadth(){
            return breadth; // Returns the value of breadth which is a private data member
        }
};
int main(){
    Rectangle r;
    r.setLength(5); // Object r has length = 10 which we set using function and not directly
    r.setBreadth(10); // Direct access of private data members isn't allowed so we use function
}
```
