# Generalizations vs Specialization

This is a topic related to inheritance. We have a class Rectangle and we are able to create object of rectangle and we can use it by calling the functions area and parameters. Then we have a class for cuboid and this class inherits the class Rectangle. Cuboid can also call the functions and create its own objects. In this case Rectangle was existing and from there we have derived cuboid. So rectangle class was already existing and we have defined a new class with extra features, a specialized class which is cuboid.  Something already exits and you derive the existing class add some more features and this leads to extending of functionality is specialization class.
